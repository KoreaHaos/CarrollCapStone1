    <h3><a id="Proposal_Synopsis"></a>Proposal Synopsis</h3>
    <p><strong>The Goal :</strong> To fully demonstrate the product of my scholastic endeavors.</p>
    <p>Accomplishing the stated goal requires two separate and very distinct facets.</p>
    <p><strong>First</strong>, to fully example three years of study requires I produce code that transverses a broad range of technological-systems and persists at multiple hardware and platform levels.</p>
    <p><strong>Second</strong>, demonstrating my current academic endeavors requires I focus on an area not previously studied.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Thus,</em></strong> I have formulated a two-pronged approach that will push my limits and give me an opportunity to test myself against the most demanding client I have ever encountered, myself.</p>
