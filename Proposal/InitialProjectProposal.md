# Project Proposal Synopsis

*Goal* : To fully demonstrate the product of my scholastic endeavours.

this project requires two separate and distinct facets. 

First, fully exampling three years of study requires I produce code that transverses a broad range of technological-systems and persists at multiple hardware and platform levels.

Second, demonstrating my current learning experiences, requires I  focus on an area not previously researched.

I have formulated a two-pronged approach that will push my limits and give me an opportunity to test myself against the most demanding client I have ever encountered, myself.

## The Proposal

* A system for cataloging, sorting, searching, and displaying the massive piles of files and data I have accumulated in the past four years.

* A research project that takes advantage of my current placement in Ewha's Embedded Software Research Center Lab.

## The Deliverables

* A persistent, always-updating, web presence that demonstrates past, present, and future Computer Science studies and accomplishments.

* An offering to the open-source community of a simple framework for building and maintaining simple websites and web applications.

* A basic demonstration of chip level coding, development, and research.

* a set of tutorials in a simple, easily followed format.
